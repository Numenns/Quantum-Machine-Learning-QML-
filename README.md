#  Quantum Machine Learning (QML)
We find ourselves on a precipice, at the end of one era and the beginning of another. One of the most significant inventions of our era, computers, is approaching its physical processing limit, where microtransistors cannot be made any smaller, and we have to find another way to increase processing capacity for computers.
This is where quantum computers come in. These are computers that use certain laws of physics to perform mathematical calculations that take our current systems thousands of years to complete, but which they can do in minutes or seconds.
Although this advancement is significant, this technology alone may not be enough. It may need to be combined with artificial intelligence to achieve more efficient and meaningful progress. Artificial intelligence, in this case machine learning, consists of algorithms that allow computers to make inferences with data without being specifically instructed to do so.
The merger of these two technologies is known as quantum machine learning, where quantum algorithms are applied to improve the efficiency and speed of data processing for machine learning, especially when working with large amounts of data.
The purpose of our PEF is to research and learn about these emerging technologies that are undoubtedly affecting our and will continue to affect not only technology and research but also our lives. The average student has vast gaps in their knowledge of these technologies, and it is our goal to deepen and improve existing knowledge of quantum machine learning.
