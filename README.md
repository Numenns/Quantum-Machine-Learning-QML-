#  Quantum Machine Learning (QML)

## Getting Started with QML

We find ourselves on a precipice, at the end of one era and the beginning of another. One of the most significant inventions of our era, computers, is approaching its physical processing limit, where microtransistors cannot be made any smaller, and we have to find another way to increase processing capacity for computers.
This is where quantum computers come in. These are computers that use certain laws of physics to perform mathematical calculations that take our current systems thousands of years to complete, but which they can do in minutes or seconds.
Although this advancement is significant, this technology alone may not be enough. It may need to be combined with artificial intelligence to achieve more efficient and meaningful progress. Artificial intelligence, in this case machine learning, consists of algorithms that allow computers to make inferences with data without being specifically instructed to do so.
The merger of these two technologies is known as quantum machine learning, where quantum algorithms are applied to improve the efficiency and speed of data processing for machine learning, especially when working with large amounts of data.
The purpose of our PEF is to research and learn about these emerging technologies that are undoubtedly affecting our and will continue to affect not only technology and research but also our lives. The average student has vast gaps in their knowledge of these technologies, and it is our goal to deepen and improve existing knowledge of quantum machine learning.

#### Quantum Mechanics Fundamentals: 

Qubit, Superposition, Entanglement, Measurement, Gates, and Collapse

What is a Qubit?

A qubit, or quantum bit, is the basic unit of information in quantum computing, introduced by Benjamin Schumacher. Unlike a classical bit, which can only be 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in superposition, representing 0, 1, and all intermediate states simultaneously. This property enables quantum computers to process vastly more information than classical systems.

Qubits can be implemented using photons, trapped ions, electrons, atoms, or superconducting circuits, but they require highly controlled environments—often near absolute zero temperatures—to prevent decoherence. Quantum computing powered by qubits could revolutionize fields like cryptography, medicine, climate research, and artificial intelligence.

Quantum Superposition


Superposition is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. It states that a particle, such as an electron or photon, can exist in multiple states at once until a measurement is made.

Mathematical form: A qubit in superposition is written as |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, with |α|² + |β|² = 1.

Bloch sphere representation: Any combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩, with different amplitudes and phases, forms a valid quantum state.

Examples: Schrödinger’s cat (alive and dead simultaneously) and the double-slit experiment (an electron passing through two slits at once).

In quantum computing, superposition enables parallel computation, giving quantum processors an advantage over classical machines. However, superpositions are fragile due to decoherence, where environmental interactions collapse the state.

Quantum Entanglement


Entanglement occurs when two or more particles share a quantum state such that the state of one cannot be described independently of the other, even at great distances.

History:

Einstein, Podolsky & Rosen (1935): proposed the EPR paradox, criticizing "spooky action at a distance."

John Bell (1964): proved with his theorem that no local hidden variable theory could explain quantum correlations.

Experiments: Starting with Alain Aspect in the 1980s, numerous tests have confirmed entanglement. In 2022, Clauser, Aspect, and Zeilinger received the Nobel Prize for proving its reality.

Applications: quantum cryptography (secure communication), quantum computing (multi-qubit operations), quantum teleportation, and quantum metrology (precise measurements).

Philosophical impact: challenges classical ideas of locality, causality, and realism.

Quantum Measurement


Quantum measurement refers to the transition of a quantum system from superposition to a definite state upon observation.

Problem of measurement: Quantum theory does not specify what exactly causes the collapse. Is it the measuring device, environmental interaction, or consciousness?

Main interpretations:

Copenhagen: collapse upon measurement.

Many-worlds: all possibilities occur in parallel universes.

Objective collapse: collapse as a physical process (e.g., gravity).

Consciousness hypothesis: observer’s awareness triggers collapse.

Famous examples: Schrödinger’s cat and the double-slit experiment.

Modern experiments: Decoherence theory explains much of collapse without invoking consciousness.

Conclusion: Measurement remains one of the deepest mysteries in physics.

Quantum Gates


Quantum gates are the building blocks of quantum circuits, analogous to classical logic gates but acting on qubits. They manipulate qubit states via unitary transformations.

Examples:

Pauli-X (NOT gate)

Pauli-Y and Pauli-Z (phase shifts)

Hadamard (creates superposition)

CNOT (creates entanglement between qubits)

Toffoli (controlled AND with three qubits)

Mathematics: represented by unitary matrices (e.g., Hadamard = (1/√2)[[1,1],[1,-1]]).

Applications:

Shor’s algorithm (factoring large numbers).

Grover’s algorithm (database search).

Quantum error correction.

Quantum simulation of molecules and materials.

Quantum gates enable circuits capable of solving problems beyond classical computing.

Quantum Collapse and Consciousness


Quantum collapse refers to the transition from a superposition of states to a single outcome upon measurement.

Main interpretations:

Copenhagen: collapse during measurement.

Many-worlds: avoids collapse altogether.

Objective collapse models: collapse as a real physical process (e.g., gravity).

Consciousness hypothesis: collapse triggered by conscious observers (explored by Wigner, von Neumann, and others).

Criticism of the consciousness hypothesis:

Decoherence explains collapse without invoking consciousness.

Consciousness lacks a clear, measurable definition.

No experiments show collapse depending on awareness.

Experimental findings: Decoherence confirmed, Penrose-Hameroff Orch-OR model limited, quantum computing experiments proposed to test consciousness collapse.

Conclusion: While speculative, the consciousness link keeps alive a fascinating dialogue between physics and philosophy.

##### About Machine Learning

Machine learning focuses on developing algorithms and models enabling computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions, there are three main types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and the reinforcement one.

Supervised

Is when the computer learns from examples that already have the correct answers. 
The data comes with labels, and the goal is to predict the right output for new data, for example a program trained with labeled photos of cats and dogs can later identify whether a new photo shows a cat or a dog.

Unsupervised

Is when the computer has no labeled answers. 
Instead, it tries to find hidden patterns or groupings within the data, for example it can analyze shopping behavior and group customers with similar habits

Reinforcement

Is when the computer learns by trial and error. 
It makes decisions, receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and adjusts its actions over time to maximize success.
