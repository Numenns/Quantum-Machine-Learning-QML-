#  Quantum Machine Learning (QML)

## Getting Started with QML

We find ourselves on a precipice, at the end of one era and the beginning of another. One of the most significant inventions of our era, computers, is approaching its physical processing limit, where microtransistors cannot be made any smaller, and we have to find another way to increase processing capacity for computers.
This is where quantum computers come in. These are computers that use certain laws of physics to perform mathematical calculations that take our current systems thousands of years to complete, but which they can do in minutes or seconds.
Although this advancement is significant, this technology alone may not be enough. It may need to be combined with artificial intelligence to achieve more efficient and meaningful progress. Artificial intelligence, in this case machine learning, consists of algorithms that allow computers to make inferences with data without being specifically instructed to do so.
The merger of these two technologies is known as quantum machine learning, where quantum algorithms are applied to improve the efficiency and speed of data processing for machine learning, especially when working with large amounts of data.
The purpose of our PEF is to research and learn about these emerging technologies that are undoubtedly affecting our and will continue to affect not only technology and research but also our lives. The average student has vast gaps in their knowledge of these technologies, and it is our goal to deepen and improve existing knowledge of quantum machine learning.

#### About Machine Learning

Machine learning focuses on developing algorithms and models enabling computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions, there are three main types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and the reinforcement one.

Supervised

Is when the computer learns from examples that already have the correct answers. 
The data comes with labels, and the goal is to predict the right output for new data, for example a program trained with labeled photos of cats and dogs can later identify whether a new photo shows a cat or a dog.

Unsupervised

Is when the computer has no labeled answers. 
Instead, it tries to find hidden patterns or groupings within the data, for example it can analyze shopping behavior and group customers with similar habits

Reinforcement

Is when the computer learns by trial and error. 
It makes decisions, receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and adjusts its actions over time to maximize success.

What is a Qubit?

Que_es_un_Qubit

A qubit, or quantum bit, is the basic unit of information in quantum computing, introduced by Benjamin Schumacher. Unlike a classical bit, which can only be 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in superposition, representing 0, 1, and all intermediate states simultaneously. This property enables quantum computers to process vastly more information than classical systems.

Qubits can be implemented using photons, trapped ions, electrons, atoms, or superconducting circuits, but they require highly controlled environments—often near absolute zero temperatures—to prevent decoherence. Quantum computing powered by qubits could revolutionize fields like cryptography, medicine, climate research, and artificial intelligence.
