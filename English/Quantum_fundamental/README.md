### What is a Qubit?

A **qubit**, or quantum bit, is the basic unit of information in quantum computing, introduced by Benjamin Schumacher.  
Unlike a classical bit, which can only be `0` or `1`, a qubit can exist in **superposition**, representing `0`, `1`, and all intermediate states simultaneously.  

Mathematical definition:  
A qubit is represented as a linear combination of basis states:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle, \quad \text{with } |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1
$$

Qubits can be implemented using **photons, trapped ions, electrons, atoms, or superconducting circuits**, but they require highly controlled environments (often near absolute zero temperatures) to prevent **decoherence**.  

Applications: **cryptography, medicine, climate research, and artificial intelligence.**

### Quantum Superposition

Superposition states that a particle (electron, photon, etc.) can exist in multiple states at once until a measurement is made.  

Mathematical form:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle, \quad |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1
$$

**Bloch Sphere Representation:**  
A qubit state can be expressed as:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)|0\rangle + e^{i\phi}\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)|1\rangle
$$

Examples: Schrödinger’s cat, double-slit experiment.

### Quantum Entanglement

Entanglement occurs when two or more particles share a state such that one cannot be described independently of the other.  

Mathematical example (Bell state):

$$
|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|00\rangle + |11\rangle)
$$

Applications: **quantum cryptography, teleportation, computing, and metrology.**

### Quantum Measurement

Quantum measurement causes the system to collapse into a definite state.  

Mathematical rule:  
When measuring $|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$:

- Probability of $|0\rangle$: $P(0) = |\alpha|^2$
- Probability of $|1\rangle$: $P(1) = |\beta|^2$

Interpretations: **Copenhagen, Many-worlds, Objective collapse, Consciousness hypothesis.**

### Quantum Gates

Quantum gates are like the building blocks of quantum computers.
They work on qubits, which are special units of information that can represent both 0 and 1 at the same time. This is different from normal computers, where each bit is either 0 or 1.

Each quantum gate changes the state of a qubit in a very specific way — you can think of it like rotating or flipping the qubit’s “direction” in a 3D space.

Common Quantum Gates

X gate (Pauli-X) – Works like a NOT gate in normal computers: it flips 0 to 1 and 1 to 0.

Y gate (Pauli-Y) – Rotates the qubit in another direction, adding a change that includes both a flip and a twist.

Z gate (Pauli-Z) – Keeps the qubit’s value but changes its “phase,” like shifting its internal timing.

Hadamard gate (H) – Makes the qubit go into a mix of 0 and 1 at the same time. This is called superposition, and it’s one of the key features of quantum computing.

Phase gates (S, T) – Change how the qubit’s wave behaves without flipping it.

CNOT gate (Controlled-NOT) – Works on two qubits. It flips the second one only if the first one is 1. This allows qubits to become entangled, meaning their values get linked together in a way that normal bits never can.

Applications: **Shor’s algorithm, Grover’s search, error correction, quantum simulation.**

### Quantum Collapse and Consciousness

Collapse is the transition from superposition to a single outcome upon measurement.  

Interpretations: **Copenhagen, Many-worlds, Objective collapse, Consciousness hypothesis.**  

Criticism of consciousness hypothesis: no empirical support, decoherence explains collapse sufficiently.
