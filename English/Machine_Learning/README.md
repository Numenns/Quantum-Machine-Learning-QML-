# About Machine Learning  
Machine learning focuses on developing algorithms and models enabling computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions, there are three main types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and the reinforcement one.  

## Supervised
Is when the computer learns from examples that already have the correct answers. The data comes with labels, and the goal is to predict the right output for new data, for example a program trained with labeled photos of cats and dogs can later identify whether a new photo shows a cat or a dog.  

## Unsupervised  
Is when the computer has no labeled answers. Instead, it tries to find hidden patterns or groupings within the data, for example it can analyze shopping behavior and group customers with similar habits.  

## Reinforcement  
Is when the computer learns by trial and error. It makes decisions, receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and adjusts its actions over time to maximize success.

## Linear Regression 

Linear Regression is a machine learning method used to predict a number (the output) based on one or more inputs. It works by finding the best straight line that connects the input data to the output data. The line shows how the output changes when the input changes.

### Simple Linear Regression (1 input)
The formula is:  

$$
Y = mX + b
$$

- **Y** = predicted value (output)  
- **X** = input value  
- **m** = slope (how much Y changes when X changes)  
- **b** = intercept (where the line starts)
