# What Does Quantum Bring to ML?
- **Superposition and entanglement:** allow representing many states at once, expanding the data space.  
- **Quantum interference:** helps highlight meaningful patterns and reduce noise.  
- **Potential advantages:** faster computation, richer data representations, and new learning methods.  
- **Current limitations:** quantum computers are still small and noisy (we are in the **NISQ** — *Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum* — era).

## Types of QML Models

| Type | Brief Description |
|------|-------------------|
| **Hybrid Classical–Quantum** | Combine classical components (like optimization and training) with parameterized quantum circuits. These are the most common today. |
| **Quantum Kernels** | Map classical data into quantum states and use quantum inner products to perform classification. |
| **VQC (Variational Quantum Classifiers)** | Quantum circuits with tunable parameters that learn to classify data based on measurements. |

## Practical Goal
Get familiar with tools such as **Qiskit**, **PennyLane**, or **TensorFlow Quantum**, and try simple experiments using **quantum simulators**.  
These experiments help understand how classical and quantum components work together in hybrid models.
